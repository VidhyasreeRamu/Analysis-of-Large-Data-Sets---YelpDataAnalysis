# Analysis-of-Large-Data-Sets---YelpDataAnalysis

Data for this project was collected: https://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge/dataset

Used data mining techniques to extract the insights from unstructured data. Answered product questions in a scientific manner using predictive modelling,statistical techniques and machine learning techniques

I have splitted the project into 4 files for better execution:
Yelp_Project_Part1:
1.	I start with getting a regression between the sentiment score and the Business rating
2.	I then create a network graph on the sentiment of the reviews

Yelp_Project_Part2:
1.	Taking up a general notion of Location influencing the star ratings and testing it. Finding any correlation between distance of a business from a popular location.
2.	Once we find the effect of a location on a business, we try to find average rating in different zones of the city. The plot explains the average rating along with the density of businesses in that zone.

Yelp_Project_Part3:
1.	Finding Influencer of a Business for targeted marketing.
2.	Recommendation of business based on user’s past star ratings given to business. [We have filled NA’s with mean and if it has only one review we have replaced ]
3.	Finding the correlation between stars given and length of the review given.

Yelp_Project_Part4:
1.	What are the most common type of restaurants in a particular state
2.	Does the length of review determine its usefulness 

Shiny App: Server.R, ui.R, app.R
